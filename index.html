    <div class="rules">
        <ul>
            <li> The Game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
            <li> In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his round score</li>
            <li> But, if the player rolls a 1, then the player looses all his scored score and his turn</li>
            <li> The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his total score and after that he losoes his turn</li>
            <li> The first player to reach 100 score or defined score wins the game</li>
            <li> Player looses all his score if he sorres 6 twice in a row</li>
